# Lung Disease Multilingual Chatbot with Voice Support ðŸ’¬

This project provides a multilingual chatbot that helps users understand and interact with PDF documents related to lung diseases. With support for voice input, the chatbot processes the uploaded PDFs, retrieves relevant information, and delivers it in a user-friendly, multilingual format.

## Features
- **Voice Input Support:** Users can record and speak their queries to interact with the chatbot.
- **Multilingual Responses:** The chatbot can respond in various languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil.
- **PDF Document Processing:** The chatbot processes and extracts text from uploaded PDF documents, allowing users to ask questions based on the content of the document.
- **Customizable User Interaction:** Choose the language for the chatbot responses and enable/disable voice input.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit** for building the web interface.
- **Langchain** for handling NLP tasks and querying vector-based embeddings.
- **Ollama** for embeddings and LLM (Language Model).
- **Chroma** for vector storage and retrieval.
- **PyPDF2** for extracting text from PDFs.
- **Deep Translator (Google Translate)** for language translation support.
- **SpeechRecognition** for transcribing voice input to text.
- **audio_recorder_streamlit** for recording voice input directly in the browser.
- **Python's Temporary Files** for processing and storing data during the session.
